## Description

It too long for the original maintainer to update the grade distribution [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS6khEB6m8cPNenNvY9Tg6bJ6YkmcvCI/edit?gid=1942445276#gid=1942445276). Therefore, I decided to improvise myself.

## Getting Started

Below are some brief instructions on setting up this project *locally*. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

**ðŸ›‘ If you only want to check the grade distribution, not contribute to it, you should use [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS6khEB6m8cPNenNvY9Tg6bJ6YkmcvCI/edit?gid=1942445276#gid=1942445276) or [this](https://qc-prof-stat.web.app/) instead. ðŸ›‘**
